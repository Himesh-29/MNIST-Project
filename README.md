# MNIST-Project

In this project, I have made a <b>deep learning model</b> which will predict what is the digit corresponding to an image of the digit.
The model file, so created to save the model, can be used again to find any prediction for any random digit by loading the MNIST set from keras.dataset

Just clone this repository using <code>git clone https://github.com/Himesh-29/MNIST-Project.git</code>, start the jupyter notebook and you can use the model file in this repository to use it for your own predictions.

### Python packages required:
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter notebook(<b>To install, just write</b> <code>pip install jupyter-notebook</code>)</li>
  <li>Tensorflow(<b>To install, just write</b> <code>pip install tensorflow</code>)</li>
  <li>Matplotlib(<b>To install, just write</b> <code>pip install matplotlib</code>)</li>
  <li>Numpy(<b>To install, just write</b> <code>pip install numpy</code>)</li>
</ul>
